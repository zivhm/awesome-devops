### Tool Entry Format

Every tool follows this exact README structure:

```markdown
# Tool Name

![Tool Name Logo](../logos/tool-logo.svg)

## Overview

[Description from main README table]

## Key Features

- Bullet points of main features

## Getting Started

Installation and usage examples with code blocks

## Resources

- [Official Website](url)
- [Documentation](url)
- [GitHub Repository](url)
```

### Adding a New Tool

1. **Create Directory Structure**

   ```bash
   mkdir -p tools/CategoryName/ToolName
   cd tools/CategoryName/ToolName
   ```

2. **Generate Template**

   ```bash
   # From repository root
   bash scripts/create_readmes.sh
   ```

3. **Add Logo**

   ```bash
   # Fetch from Simple Icons CDN
   bash logos/fetch_logos.sh toolname

   # Apply local logo references
   python3 logos/apply_logos.py
   ```

4. **Update Main README**
   * Add tool entry to appropriate category table
   * Ensure description matches tool README overview

5. **Validate**

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/validate_readmes.py
   ```

### Logo Management

The repository uses a comprehensive logo management system:

* **Storage**: Logos stored as `logos/toolname.svg`
* **Referencing**: `../logos/toolname.svg` (from tool directory)
* **Fetching**: `bash logos/fetch_logos.sh toolname`
* **Application**: `python3 logos/apply_logos.py` replaces external URLs
* **Validation**: Logo existence checked during README validation

### Validation & Quality Assurance

Before submitting contributions, run validation:

```bash
# Validate all READMEs
python3 scripts/validate_readmes.py

# Returns exit code 1 on validation failures
# Checks: header format, logo existence, required sections, content structure
```

### Content Synchronization

Tool descriptions in main README tables are the source of truth:

```bash
# Sync descriptions from main README to individual tool READMEs
python3 scripts/update_summaries.py
```
